This repository demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code that attempts to access data from a Firebase Realtime Database query before the promise resolves.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code using async/await to handle the asynchronous operation properly.  This error is easily overlooked and can cause unexpected behavior and application crashes.
